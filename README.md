## Live Demo
The real benefit of the app is the capability to connect it to any space which uses the [Product Catalogue Space Template][5]. Once the app is connected to a user controlled version of the [Product Catalogue Space Template][5], all changes to the space in [Contentful's UI][6] will be reflected in the app.

    - create a new space in https://app.contentful.com
    - **IMPORTANT**: make sure to create it from the [Product Catalogue Space Template][5]
2. Connect the space to the demo application

    - paste in your API key and space ID
    - click on "save session" and / or save the deeplink for your convenience
